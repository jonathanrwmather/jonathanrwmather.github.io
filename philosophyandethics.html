    <h2>The three philosophical questions:</h2>
    <p2>There are three philosophical questions related to AI:</p2>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Is artificial general intelligence possible? Can a machine solve any problem that a human being can solve using intelligence? Or are there hard limits to what a machine can accomplish?</li>
      <li>Are intelligent machines dangerous? How can we ensure that machines behave ethically and that they are used ethically?</li>
      <li>Can a machine have a mind, consciousness and mental states in exactly the same sense that human beings do? Can a machine be sentient, and thus deserve certain rights? Can a machine intentionally cause harm?</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>The limits of AI:</h2>
    <p1>Can a machine be intelligent? Can it "think"?</p1>
    <br>
    <h3>Alan Turing's "polite convention"-</h3>
    <p2>We need not decide if a machine can "think"; we need only decide if a machine can act as intelligently as a human being. This approach to the philosophical problems associated with artificial intelligence forms the basis of the Turing test</p2>
    <br>
    <h3>The Dartmouth proposal-</h3>
    <p2>"Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it." This conjecture was printed in the proposal for the Dartmouth Conference of 1956</p2>
    <br>
    <h3>Newell and Simon's physical symbol system hypothesis-</h3>
    <p2>"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action." Newell and Simon argue that intelligence consists of formal operations on symbols. Hubert Dreyfus argued that, on the contrary, human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation and on having a "feel" for the situation rather than explicit symbolic knowledge. </p2>
    <br>
    <h3>Gödelian arguments-</h3>
    <p2>Gödel himself,John Lucas (in 1961) and Roger Penrose (in a more detailed argument from 1989 onwards) made highly technical arguments that human mathematicians can consistently see the truth of their own "Gödel statements" and therefore have computational abilities beyond that of mechanical Turing machines.[338] However, some people do not agree with the "Gödelian arguments".</p2>
    <br>
    <h3>The artificial brain argument-</h3>
    <p2>The brain can be simulated by machines and because brains are intelligent, simulated brains must also be intelligent; thus machines can be intelligent. Hans Moravec, Ray Kurzweil and others have argued that it is technologically feasible to copy the brain directly into hardware and software and that such a simulation will be essentially identical to the original</p2>
    <br>
    <h3>The AI effect-</h3>
    <p2>Machines are already intelligent, but observers have failed to recognize it. When Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov in chess, the machine was acting intelligently. However, onlookers commonly discount the behavior of an artificial intelligence program by arguing that it is not "real" intelligence after all; thus "real" intelligence is whatever intelligent behavior people can do that machines still cannot. This is known as the AI Effect: "AI is whatever hasn't been done yet."</p2>
